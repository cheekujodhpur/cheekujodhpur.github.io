This is presented as an inexpensive DIY display. It works on the principle of Pepper’s Ghost i.e. we simultaneously see a reflection of the image displayed on the screen with the background, which results in a perception of a floating 3D image.</p>

        <h2>Epic Chat Battles of Historyyy</h2>
        <p>In this project, we consider the problem of generating a self-sustaining dialogue between two or more actors who speak with their own distictive styles. Seq2seq models have been successfully used to train recurrent neural networks to learn the mapping from one sequence of words to another. Here, we aim to see if such networks can be trained to share a common context vector space to enable a common understanding between the two actors.</p>

        <p>This project was done as part of <a href="https://hackinout.co/">Hack InOut</a>, a 30 hour hackathon held at Bengaluru in Fall 2017. There was a blockchain track and we had never explored this trending technology before, so we figured we would do something in this space. However, our idea can be implemented, and perhaps in a better manner, without blockchain as well. With due gratitude to Gnosis who sponsored the first prize that we got in the Blockchain Track, and whose platform we used in the hackathon implementation, I would discuss the idea independent of an implementation.</p>

        <p>In this project, we use observations of IRAS 16164-5046 in 1280 MHz band of GMRT, to try
to find the exact spectral type of the OB stars which are candidate ionising sources for HII
regions in the observed area. This would give us an idea about what stage of star formation
they are in. Comparing this to the environment, we can deduce parts of the full story of star
formation. Based on the morphology of HII regions, we can deduce star formation related
events that occurred/are occurring in the region.</p>

        <h2>Haskell versus Excel</h2>
        <p>While trying to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, I came across a spreadhseet which had calculations for the magnetic field produced based on the thickness of the wire, voltage available and radius of the solenoid. The calculation for optimal parameters gets complicated because you also have to think of heat generated which changes the resistance of the wire and perhaps a few other issues. The spreadsheet had all the calculations encoded and we just had to input some parameters and it would output the rest. It was very handy, but it struck me then, spreadsheets are just programs</p>

        <p>We made a webcam spectrograph using an optical CD as the diffraction grating as our course project for Waves, Oscillation and Optics (EP 226). As processing the camera images on a computer would be too boring, we used an RPi board with embedded camera which we happened to have. The RPi could process and transmit the data over WiFi enabling us to access the results from any computer, in principle. This made the spectrograph completely portable.</p>

        <p>
Mankind has a specific interest in exoplanets driven by the assumption that life can only originate and exist on planets. A detailed catalogue of RR Lyrae stars could help get information about the origin of the cluster, and we have an opportunity to detect microlensing(ML) events which indicate existence of exoplanets in the GC.

        <h2>The King Under the Elevator</h2>
        <p>In my first semester at IIT Bombay, I was put in Hostel 15. The building had 10 floors and my room was on the sixth. Within a week, the display for the floor number inside the lift stopped working. This meant that everytime the lift stopped, someone had to peek outside to check which floor we’re on. To tackle this minor inconvenience, we (me and <a href="http://sandeshkalantre.github.io/">Sandesh</a>) came up with a jugaad.</p>

        <h2>Estimating Photometric Redshifts using Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
        <p>Redshift measurements are vital to modern astrophysics. Using spectral line shifts is an accurate method to calculate redshift for a distant galaxy but the observation time to develop the spectrum is quite high and the result’s accuracy has a high dependence on SNR, which drastically limits its use to applications which require us to find redshifts for a large number of objects.</p>
