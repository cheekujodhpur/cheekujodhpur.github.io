		<p>The milk usually served in the mess at H15@IITB is hot. That'a good news. It's too hot. That often keeps me waiting for it to cool down. I often try out different cooling techniques as they come into my "Dadi ke Nuskhe" (<i>Grandmother's advice</i>) skillset. One of them is taking two glasses and one glass full of milk which is continuously poured from one glass to another. One fine evening, we ended up discussing various reasons due to which this works.</p>
		<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Milk cools via one surface of the glass and one of it's own, but when it is poured out of the glass, the heat stored in the glass releases from two surfaces (in and out).</li>
				<li>As milk is poured out of a glass, there's a thin layer left on the inside which gets vaporised sucking heat of vaporisation from metal. This adds to the effect achieved in the previous point.</li>
			</ul>
			<i>These points are emphasized in the illustration below:</i>
		</p>
		<h3>Variables</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Temperature of glasses as a function of time</b> - This assumes that the temperature gradient across the glass surface is null, or in other words, infinite heat conductivity is assumed. Also, the pouring process is assumed to be instantaneous. I promise I'll be quick.</li>
				<li><b>Temperature of environment as a function of time</b> - Sufficiently far from the glasses. Why do I need this? Because YOLO!</li>
				<li><b>Amount of milk remaining in glass</b> - as a function of temperature. There is a very interesting way to measure this. Pour milk at a certain temperature into ten different identical glasses, and measure the difference in volume. Divide that by 10 to get an estimate on the required value.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Parameters</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Time I wait</b> - The time I wait before repouring </li>
				<li><b>Dimensions</b> - Because YOLO!</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Experiment</h3>
