		<p>
			Someday in May 2013, I was selected to represent the Indian Team at International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics to
			be held in volos,greece in July-August that year. I had received the travel bug an year ago and had read enough of travelogues 
			to be interested in writing my own at an amateur level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following chapters hold records written during the event. The usage of words and a slight tinge of immaturity must be noted. I
			initially wanted to run an editorial filter over it before finally porting it online after more than an year, but raw record is well...raw. The purity of the content will also capture my mood in the moment.
