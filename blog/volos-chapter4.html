			The breakfast is served. It is real good but standard bread, butter, jam, juice. We are bored after the breakfast. There is nothing on schedule for us. People have started studying. This is not good. It comes down to us to break the chain. If we don't, soon all will be busy studying and there'll no interaction.
		</p>
		<h3>11:00 a.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We urge our hosts to arrange for some indoor games. At first, they offer us Backgammon, which we have no idea how to play. Later, but soon enough, we had about 4 decks of cards, 2 chess and 2 backgammon games alongwith some kind of greek dice game.
		</p>
		<p>
			We sit down to play with a bunch of greek guides to various teams who had been bored since their teams were either sleeping or studying. I don't find it possible to describe the variety of card games that we went on to play till lunch. Other people jouned. We did seem to succeed in breaking the chain to an extent, yeah!
		</p>
		<h3>5:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We went for hiking up the Mt. Pelion with the 'experts'. Oh! the hills and the valleys we could witness. It was an amazing but tiring experience. We wanted to go to the source of the water spring that fed us and the villages on the mountains, but time didn't permit.
