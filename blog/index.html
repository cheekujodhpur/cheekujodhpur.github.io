            I do not understand why would I want to keep this a single HTML file. Maybe because I do not want to go forward with the trouble of finding something to organize these thoughts which I would not bother about in a few weeks. I want to be more Hemingway in my writing style though. That last sentence did not work out well. Maybe I could record these things while typing them. Eventually so. I've never actually read Hemingway though, but have felt inspired nonetheless by numerous anecdotes and quotations that make their way through my daily news feed.
