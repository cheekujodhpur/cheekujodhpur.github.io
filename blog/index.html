            I do not understand why would I want to keep this a single HTML file. Maybe because I do not want to go forward with the trouble of finding something to organize these thoughts which I would not bother about in a few weeks. I want to be more Hemingway in my writing style though. That last sentence did not work out well. Maybe I could record these things while typing them. Eventually so. I've never actually read Hemingway though, but have felt inspired nonetheless by numerous anecdotes and quotations that make their way through my daily news feed.

            I do it now because I did it in IPhO 2015 and IoAA 2016 and now I am used to it. I don't remember why I did it then. By 'it', I mean rising up to the responsibilities which were not meant for me. The pleasure of feeling more useful and responsible than your peers is definitely the driving force but there are parts of it that I wish I could explain better. Heck, even noting those parts explicitly here would be an achievement. <br />
            The way it works is following: I see something failing terribly. I think I can save it. I enter and try my best to save it; and it almost does end up breathing vividly. Almost always. Actually, always. What if I let go like others? Will there always be someone to take care of it? stand in place of me? what if no one stands up? will it fail? there is no way I could know at this point because I've always stood up whenever I saw the opportunity; taken command in my own hands and get as many things done as possible. At this point, I am thankful for this trait developed in me due to certain people and experiences that I had the 'lucky'opportunity to handle.

            In a conversation with Varun Bhalerao, who passed out from IITB about 10 years ago, circa 2007, who is a founding member of Krittika-Astronomy Club of IITB recently joined us as a Professor in the Department of Physics. He mentioned how they discovered that their club was the third iteration of an astronomy club in the institute; as far as they could know. The first was by Yogesh Wadadekar, who is now a researcher at NCRA, TIFR and a good mentor to me.<br />
            This led me back to what I have told my descendants as the commanders of web n coding club, iitb to keep in mind while running the club. 'We are not vital to the functionings of the institute. It would not make a huge difference to the world if we were to fall. Hence, always keep in mind that we are a hobby club and we do things for fun. But if we were to fall, another would rise as a natural need to have a community of like-minded people.' With more contemplation and discussion with Sandesh, I reached the conclusion that this natural course of death and birth for clubs at IITB might actually be not a bad thing at all. This is just like the City of Zion in the Matrix series. The city is destroyed, and rebuilt. Everyone thinks they are the first but they are not. The previous ones have all been forgotten. And it is not very difficult for us to fall because it is very hard to continue the initiatives of your predecessors as you are not equally enthusiastic about it.<br />
           But maybe you do want to preserve what you built. How do you do? How do you ensure it is not forgotten? You write history, and you preserve it. You etch it in stone. A physical manifestation present as a living reminder of the long way you've come. History is an interesting concept. It is often not an unbiased documentation of events. It is rather an interpretation of the past; an interpretation which keeps changing based on your current beliefs. Things will still keep falling and rising; but when they rise again, you would and could only hope that they don't repeat the mistakes. That the past falls have not been forgotten.

            I don't even know the meaning of the word properly I guess...having a bad day, not even sure if I should write about it this way. I really don't know what to think. not sure...just so that this stays as a reminder...this is the day I fought sandesh about me being arrogant
            <br />
            This paragraph starts when I am more stable, after reading some notes written for my birthday by my sweetheart. There are so many bad things coming to my mind to say, to take revenge upon the guy who hurt me. It wasn't even a 1v1. always had someone else around who was targetting me back. what is it to be wise than not to care? I don't think i don't care. i do. but if I actually act on hatred and spite coming from things he has said about me then there is no use of that right? i lose. my sweetie says i am wise. even i think i am. i am arrogant and overconfident and crazy enough to think i'm like jack sparrow: there is often an overlap between brilliance and lunacy. i know i always ponder a lot about all decisions that i take. nobody really agrees because they are quick...and when I claim that those decisions work for me, I am arrogant? 
            <br />
            was it not visible enough that i was feeling attacked and was simply defending myself? i surrendered at the end. not a physical war, so no losses for surrendering except the winner thinks he dominates you. maybe he does. it doesn't matter. i am not interested in a war. i am happy in lyf due to tonnes of things which are not my ego winning. this is so circular. if i "say" that I am better because i don't mind those things, then i am again helping my ego. i am preserving it in a safe box, covering it with a virtual shell. even if i "feel" that I am better because I am wiser, I am not truly wise. But that is who I want to be. I want to be truly wise. So what do i do? i don't think about it. i take what is to gain here and move on.
            <br />
            but what really is to gain here? that I should be less arrogant towards people? maybe i am being too influenced by one of my close friends and talking in a tone that sounds rude. i should stop doing that. how else do i talk then? maybe i talk less. talk whenever necessary and try to sound diplomatic and polite. this is in context with the department. maybe even more. effectively, i shud assimilate my arrogance into my complete personality and present a dual to people, be fake. that is not a problem anyways. i can portray any personality that people want of me. i am a very good method actor. that is how most of my current outward personality is formed :P except my wisdom and my love for my girl, or who knows why i mentioned these exceptions. i shud just sleep at dis point.
