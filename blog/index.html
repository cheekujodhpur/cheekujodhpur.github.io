            I do not understand why would I want to keep this a single HTML file. Maybe because I do not want to go forward with the trouble of finding something to organize these thoughts which I would not bother about in a few weeks. I want to be more Hemingway in my writing style though. That last sentence did not work out well. Maybe I could record these things while typing them. Eventually so. I've never actually read Hemingway though, but have felt inspired nonetheless by numerous anecdotes and quotations that make their way through my daily news feed.

            I do it now because I did it in IPhO 2015 and IoAA 2016 and now I am used to it. I don't remember why I did it then. By 'it', I mean rising up to the responsibilities which were not meant for me. The pleasure of feeling more useful and responsible than your peers is definitely the driving force but there are parts of it that I wish I could explain better. Heck, even noting those parts explicitly here would be an achievement. <br />
            The way it works is following: I see something failing terribly. I think I can save it. I enter and try my best to save it; and it almost does end up breathing vividly. Almost always. Actually, always. What if I let go like others? Will there always be someone to take care of it? stand in place of me? what if no one stands up? will it fail? there is no way I could know at this point because I've always stood up whenever I saw the opportunity; taken command in my own hands and get as many things done as possible. At this point, I am thankful for this trait developed in me due to certain people and experiences that I had the 'lucky'opportunity to handle.
