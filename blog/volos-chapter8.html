			Eeezy Peezy! We had already solved the question they gave, so it was a matter of decorating our Excel spreadsheets which took our time. We are currently moving to and for the Archaelogical Museum. I am really wishing the observational exam tonight is not obscured by clouds.

			I was in group 3 of 5. Clouds came while I gave my exam. All scores cancelled. Indoor attempt tomorrow.
