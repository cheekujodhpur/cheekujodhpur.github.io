		<p>On a fine weekday morning, I decided to chew gum while being bored in an organic chemistry class. It is perfectly alright to do so, according to the moral police. Chewing gum is a promised way to keep you awake and alert(maybe). But the <em>interesting</em> class had to end sometime. One of my friends pulled out a chocolate on the way out and offered me a share(generosity). I took it in without throwing out the chewing gum. I wanted to continue chewing the gum.</p>
		<p>Lo and behold! The chewing gum melts and goes in with the chocolate. That was a moment full of horror. The possibility of molten gum hardening along my oesophagus scared the hell out of me. What's more? My friends didn't believe me. They assumed I swallowed it and am under the illusion that it melted. I needed help to prove my point.</p>
		<p>
		Googling revealed that cocoa butter is an emulsifier for gum base. This trick may not work on all gums, as bases are different, but perfectly tested and <em>discovered</em> for Happydent brand gums.
