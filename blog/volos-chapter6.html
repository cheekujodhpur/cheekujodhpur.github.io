			The theoretical exam which was supposed to start at 9, began at 10. It was easy, but that's the problem, isn't it? It would
			be easy for all and a small mistake further in the olympiad can cost us medals
		</p>
		<h3>4:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We got our lunch (pizzas) later than others since 4 of 5 members in our team are vegetarians. Others finish our lunch with the Bangladesh
			and Iran teams who were in a similar situation. We are currently going to "galaxy" club for Bowling and Billiards. Yep! They chose this club just because of its name. genius!
		</p>
		<h3>9:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Back for dinner! Didn't really win at either Bowling or Billiards but did well! Lost 5 euros in a gift-pitcher game. I guess those games are meant to be stupid! I had never done Bowling or Billiards ever before in my life, as this was indeed an experience I desired.

			In our bus back home, I was close to beating up a Portugese guy who had 'derogatory' misconceptions about India, such as "We start worshipping cows when they block traffich instead of shooing them."
		</p>
		<p>
			I was tired enough to control my instincts! Haha!
