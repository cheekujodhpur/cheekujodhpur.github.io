		<h3>July 27, 2013 2:26 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Waiting in the hotel lobby for further procedures. Made a tour of the pier in the morning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The greek idea of Black Forest Cake is different and better than ours. The more I live in this city, or stay rather than live,
it appears to be quite similar to 'Vice City'. We'll be moved to another hotel in the mountains. It is certainly not a good idea. A place within the city would give me more opportunities to roam around.
		</p>
		<h3>5:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Our to-be guide is still missing. We are moving to the port for opening ceremony. It is doubtful if they can house everybody on the port.
		</p>
		<h3>6:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We roamed around the area, saw the stage and set-up for the opening ceremony. 15 min later, we try to enter the port again, they started checking out IDs. But we'd already been inside!!! Hilarious! On another hand, greek people love graffiti. Everything, even the train toilets, have been graffitied.
		</p>
		<h3>7:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We finally meet our guide, Ioannis Zachilas. He's real fun. But here's the surprise. There is an ornamental bridge between the port and the pier. We are not getting a show for the opening ceremony. Rather, 'we' are the show for the people of Volos. We were to walk via the bridge into the port shaking/waving hands to the people. I don't know if I liked the feeling. Seemed like a fashion show. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another thing worthy of mention is that they wrote "North Korea" on the display instead of "South Korea" saying 'Mistakes happen'. I am not sure if this was a mistake. Haha!
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, there was this orchestra directed by Mr. Vasilis Tasoudis. We listened to the Olympiad Anthem and then the orchestra went on for about 2.5 hrs. I guess there was no programme except "Keep the people busy till we arrange buses for them." Fortunately, the orchsetra was good.
		</p>
		<h3>11:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We're all standing outside the temp hotel waiting for the buses which will take us to our "permanent" home for next 7 days. Someone started clapping. Everybody started clapping hence, accompanied by hoots. No one knew why. But it kind of cheered us up so everyone followed.
		</p>
		<h3>midnight</h3>
		<p>
			We are at the hotel. It's good and chilly. I got two roommates. Ivan from Serbia and Hossein from Iran. I don't know if I'll ever remember their last names. zzzz!!!!
