			The day was generally boring, yet! We got our electronic devices back in the morning, since all exams are finally over.! We sent messages home and then went on to watch a movie. I left in 5 min with Ashutosh to seek permission to visit the city. We were 24 km away and had no conveyance. I had an idea of asking for lift, but the organizer felt that if everybody starts doing it, it would be a chaos. Ashutos left on foot, went 12 km downhill to a village named Portaria, and came back just now. I must say I am jealous. We are all gonna get ready for the party. This is the time to dance all your worries off!

			The party's over! We did dance for 2 hrs but left the floor when people started to smoke and drink. I don't really like the smell of either. Inspite of everything, our leaders met us tonight; to sadden us, of course. What was feared did happen. About 15 people did well on Observational Exam and took the gold medals. We were expecting a 1-2-2 tally. Not good. Before the dreaded 16 min, we were at 4-1-0. This is not good. Although, the best thing was that our leader told us that it is absolutely not our fault. Usually, he scolds us for our mistakes, but the fact that he was happy from us, made us get a good sleep.
