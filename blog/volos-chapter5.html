			After breakfast, we were taken for games (football, volleyball, chess) etc. Their aim was to make us meet and know new people as we try to understand our randomly allotted team. And yes, they did succeed in their idea. I am not ashamed to write that our team(football) didn't win a single game, though we didn't really lose all of them.

		<h3>3:00 p.m.</h3>

			Today, was supposed to be Team Competition in the evening, so we planned to rest. But, since it is now postponned till Friday, we're going to the Afternoon games. But I will surely play the 'leisure games'. I do not wish to tire myself before tomorrow's Theoretical Exam.

		<h3>9:00 p.m.</h3>

			Back for dinner The games were hell, well in a good way. We played frog football(supposed to be popular in greece), Enter the Black Hole and Pluck the Waterons. There is an incidence which happened before these games were played which is more worthy of mention. There were a total of two grounds, seperated by a cliff. That is you could climb up to the higher ground, from the lower one. The higher field had facilities for Football and Volleyball while the ones we chose to play leisure games were in the lower field. In a strange hour, a ball came flying down to us. I could not find myself capable enough to kick the ball that high, about a 50 m. So, I figured I would climb the cliff. There were some thorny shrubs I didn't seem to care about. But they didn't like the feeling of me climbing over me. All the places on my arm and legs down the knees had rashes over them. Surprisingly, I kept my calm, wrapped my jacket over my arms to avoid further damaged and came back down. I was sent up for medic. THe incharge there asked me to wash my arms and legs in cold water till the medic arrives. I don't think he ever called the medic, since 5 minutes later, he came to me and said,<br /> "Does it pain?". <br />I replied, "No, just a bit itchy".<br /> He said, "Well, don't worry! It's not poisonous. You can go back and play now." <br />
Did he really wait for 5 min for me to die t see if it's poisonous or he was just messing up with me? I never really got the chance to ask.

			In another incidence, we played a game which involved wearing/taking off your footwear and runnning and blah blah blah! I happened to be the best at it, since I was wearing sleepers, IYKWIM.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being tired, I slept in the bus back to the hotel.
