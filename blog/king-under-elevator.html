		<p>Contrary to how rhetoric the name sounds, the project was serious in terms of science though a hobby to permit us to have all the fun in the world. The elevators in our hostels had the floor indicators broken, so you would have no idea which floor the elevator has reached except one tiny but important piece of information; the time it took to travel as a function of number of floors travelled. We decided to collect data, and then determine the function mentioned. This would then allow us to determine which floor we've reached. </p>
		<p>There is less need for me to describe the formalities here, as you can download the article we wrote about it. <a href = "tke_report.pdf">>></a></p>
		<p>Of course, by the time we completed this, the indicator got repaired</p>
