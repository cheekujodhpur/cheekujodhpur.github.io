		<p><i>Often, very often I talk absolute garbage. Some have also remarked that it is sometimes that I talk sense, and rubbish otherwise. I don't blame them. This effect, by the way, becomes visible after sundown but that is no guarantee. For example, this post is being written in bright daylight.</i></p>

            Now most people don't react to this much. Some smirk it off, close friends ignore, closer ones pity, but then there's Master Sandesh who comes up with these wonderful returns. This post is supposed to maintain a collection of them, because I'm probably too bored right now.

        This was absolutely random on my part.<br />
        "I think I am getting mad, more mad day by day"<br />
        And then he came up with,<br />
        "Aren't we all?"<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        There was roadblock due to some construction going around the hostel, and he mentioned his annoyance with the obstacle. Then I said,<br />
        "What is life but a series of obstacles?"<br />
        But he couldn't just stay shut, could he?<br />
        "It could be a dance party, you know!"<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        I had just made up a sentence, and wanted to see people's reaction to it. I met Sandesh on the dinner table and went,<br />
        "This friendship might be dangerous for you. I could be a psychopath who eventually kills you."<br />
        And I didn't expect anything of the sort that he said. Quite calmly, he said,<br />
        "That's time."<br />
