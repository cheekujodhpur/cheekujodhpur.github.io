			We went for the Chess Tournament in the morning. We were supposed to play 6 rounds. I lost my first two, given a bye in the 3rd and was about to win the 4th and actually won it, my opponent made a foul and we couldn't really decide who wins, althought it should've been me. My opponent was from Korea and we didn't really intend to worsen our relations (they are good) by saying "You fouled!!" Hence, frustrated by the game, we left without finishing the tournament. We were not sad because we repeatedly lost; none of us really knew the tactics like others who had participated in the tournament. We just knew the rules. We had just participated as we get to know more people through a game. Another nice idea of the organizers! Anyways, we were sad because all our opponents expected to lose against us. They had an opinion that since India is the "mother of chess", all Indians must be really good at playing Chess. Well, all of them had their misconceptions cleared at the end of the game. At least, we have something to be glad of.
