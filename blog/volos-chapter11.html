			Jealous  by Ashutosh' expedition yesterday, we hired two taxis to go downtown. They are here. Others(other teams) prefer to stay here.
		</p>
		<h3>5:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			We roamed around, shopped a litle, although missed on 90% of my planned shopping since almost all the shops are closed on Sunday. We had our first seafood in greece. They officially served us nothing from sea to cut budgets but today was our unofficial tour. We met a lot of John's (guide) friends and relatives (it's a small town) on the road.
		</p>
		<p>
			We all tasted alchohol. Tsipouro, essentially spirit,  42.5% alcohol, a form of brandy. I took a sip and didn't like the taste, but yeah, it was a first time experience and I have something to brag about.
		</p>
		<h3>9:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Closing ceremony over. The team got 2 silvers and 3 bronzes. Everybody is really angry owing to the messy observational exam. Here's the result:<br />
		Me, Sandesh:Silver<br />
		Ashutosh, Sheshansh, Arindam:Bronze<br />
		We are just satisfied that we made new friends. BTW, our team came rank 5 in team competition. We have planned to take revenge next year in Romania.
