		<p>About a week ago, me and Sandesh discussed the need to know German. It is one of the widely spoken languages and we all love German ladies, but more importantly a lot of valuable scientific documents and books exist in German, untranslated. Couple of weeks ago, others like Yash and Kshitij from Mechanical Dept. discussed with me the need to learn German with the perspective of getting a good Engineering job in Germany as well as some good mechanical books written in the language.</p>
		<p>There was no reason to not start it. Since Saturday night, we are all on a quest to learn German. Not to sound like an advertisement, we're using <a href = "http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>. Do check it out. They're awesome.</p>
