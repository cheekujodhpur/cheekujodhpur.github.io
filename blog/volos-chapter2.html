			Met Serbian and Korean teams at Istanbul Airport. Bought Turkish Delight.

			Our temporary hotel is by the coast. A cool breeze flows off my cheeks.

			The dinner was amazing. The menu is unimportant as compared to the fact that we sat on tables on street outside the restaurant. Why? Because this is one of the things unique to Europe.
