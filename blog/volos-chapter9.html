			Today is Beach Day/ They also have to conduct the Team and Observational Exam today. We're all scared that they'll cancel the beach. No one wants that to happen. The news is that we're going to the beach, as our guide has just woke up.
		</p>
		<h3>1:00 p.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Wohoo! We swam and ate at the beach. The water is salty and as they say, "greek blue". I happen to agree. It is indeed a distinct shade of blue. Nothing like you've seen before.

		<h3>5:00 p.m.</h3>

			We are just about to move for Examination. We've been interviewed for tomorrow's newsletter on how we put astronomy in our life and blah blah blah.  All of us gave punchliners, so I expect the article to be highly edited.

		<h3>9:00 p.m.</h3>

			Duh! The team comptetion was a crossword, 180 questions, 90 minutes. It was fun, but fact-based, so I don't know if we did good. As far as the observational exam is concerned, I have to say a lot about it. First of all, I don't like it a bit reasonable that a single question(for 16 min) can decide our 25% f the marks. None of our team got it. I will be honest. I am hoping that no one gets it. That'll save us. Even if a single person solves it, we are doomed. All our efforts in Theory and Data will be rendered futile. I really don't consider this a fault of myself. The question was least associated to astroonomy as we use it in our lives. I agree that we could solve it if we thought of it in a logical sense. I accept that I should've expected anything. I rather kept myself prepared for conventional questions. I do admit my incompetency in this sense.

			We are taken for dinner to a fast food chain named "goody's" The food is much like McDonalds but I wonder if one opens a similar enterprise in India, some thing indigenous, she would make huge profits.
		</p>
		<h3>12:00 a.m.</h3>
		<p>
			Didn't intend to sleep tonight as all the exam part of the olympiad was finally over. But finally giving up to cracking joints and a fuzzy head.
