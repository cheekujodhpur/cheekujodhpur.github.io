        <title>A black hole through the looking glass: Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am doing my first formal Graphics course right now. I have ideas about the basic jargon because I spent a week trying to learn DirectX back in school. But ray tracing was definitely something new. In my opinion, any one who has thought a lot about it would gain an intuitive idea about ray tracing, because it&#39;s exactly what it says it is. To formally get started with it, I read a book called &lt;i&gt;Introduction to Ray Tracing&lt;/i&gt; by Andrew S. Glassner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this book, I studied the &lt;i&gt;smallpt&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/&quot;&gt;code by Kevin Beason&lt;/a&gt;. This is pretty much codegolfing, because this boasts of being a 99 line cpp code for raytracing. My guide Prof. Parag Chaudhuri emphasized correctness before speed, and hence we concluded that if I achieve the image generated by smallpt using integration of the ray paths along straight lines, we can move on to curved spacetimes just by changing a small function somewhere in the code which controls the said integration. This took more time than expected. The following is the story of what I was doing and the outputs I got, accompanied by what I did to correct for it. Here is an image from smallpt which you can use for reference at every step I talk about below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;original&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;border:solid 1px black;&quot; src=&quot;/media/grsmallpt/result_200.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;Fig 1. Original Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;i&gt;legendary&lt;/i&gt; ideas on how I can move my ray along 3d pixels, also called voxels by many. If the voxel I am in intersects with some sphere in the scene, I break down the current voxel in 8 smaller voxels and travel along them, repeating this until I am some epsilon away from the sphere. Of course when I say &lt;i&gt;legendary&lt;/i&gt; I mean stupid. Because here is what I got.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A black hole through the looking glass: Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you have seen &lt;i&gt;Interstellar&lt;/i&gt;, the famed Nolan movie. Now having a black hole in the scene brings a natural question &quot;How does a black hole look?&quot; Well, a dark patch on the sky simply models the black hole, or more precisely, everything inside the Schwarschild radius of the BH. A more interesting question, then is to ask &quot;How do things look around a black hole?&quot; Even a law major would&#39;ve come across enough popular science to know that light bends around a black hole. If you stretch your imagination, you can see objects getting distorted and being able to see things not in direct line of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a bit accurate about all this and generate a CGI of how it&#39;ll really look, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03809&quot;&gt;this (arXiv 1502.03609)&lt;/a&gt; is what was done for Interstellar. They describe it well enough that any one with a fair amount of knowledge of coding can try it out at home, and in fact explicitly encourage this for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you Google &lt;i&gt;black hole raytracing&lt;/i&gt; or something similar, then you get a beautiful &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://rantonels.github.io/starless/&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. Frankly, I did not feel very good at seeing this. This does almost everything that I wanted to do, until I realized something about this and the other Relativistic Ray Tracing codes written for astrophysical research. They solve some metrics in some situations, and only take into account specific scattering models which do not help if I want to look at the situation out of an astrophysical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure I&#39;d have left you pondering about what do I really want to do then over the last few sentences. I&#39;ll be exemplar in requesting you to imagine how would your face look if we&#39;re sitting across a table and there is a blackhole hovering between us. Yes, this probably does not have direct value to astroph research, but when you think about it, our faces can easily be replaced by accretion disks and the scattering model of reflection/refraction which is used in such scenarios can be replaced with an astrophysically relevant scattering model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hence begins the journey of trying to see how would a black hole look if it were kept in your room.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS475m Assignment 1 Report</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was a group assignment and the report represents joint efforts of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keshav Srinivasan&lt;/b&gt; (140260001) and &lt;b&gt;Kumar Ayush&lt;/b&gt; (140260016)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report is structured as follows. Section A summarises a comparison between the features our program has and what the specifications demanded. Section B describes the timeline of our project, highlighting certain decisions we took and the implications they had. Section C describes known bugs. Section D is a concluding note. We end with citing our sources, and an appendix of exemplar screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Are the specs met?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The color_t, pen_t, fill_t, point_t and line_t classes are implemented as described.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our triangle_t class does not store the color of the border. The triangle is drawn with the current pen color.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The drawing_t class is implemented as described.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The canvas_t class is implemented as described, except we have a 1D array, which represents the squashed 2D array of pixels since glDrawPixels requires a pointer to a 1D array. This seemed easier to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We save and load as described&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have a concept of &lt;i&gt;drawing&lt;/i&gt; points as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While drawing lines and triangles, we interpret &lt;i&gt;successively&lt;/i&gt; clicked vertices as having a desire to draw a series of lines and triangles i.e. clicking a third point while in line mode will draw another line between the second and third point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right-click takes back the last point clicked, not only in line and triangle mode, but works as &#39;Undo&#39; for all actions in the program except clear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our fill is a toggle, a mode of its own. You can keep clicking once in fill mode and it fills the respective quad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have an eraser mode on pressing &#39;E&#39;. This is a toggle mode.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The co-ordinate system in my pixel array was set to (0,0) at top-left corner while the mouse() function returned co-ordinates with (0,0) at bottom-left corner. We made an explicit conversion while mutating pixels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. The Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skeletal structure of all classes is written.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We now have to implement the draw method for the point. We have an argument if we should draw a point or not, and if we do, should we do it with a width? A circular width or a square width? For ease of implementation, we settled for a square width, but there is an ambiguity here. If the pen width is an odd number, we can get away with drawing a square around the clicked point. But for an even width, the clicked point will lie asymmetrically within the drawn square. We eventually settled that this bias is OK since the maximum error we have is of one pixel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Bresenham algorithm is a bit complicated for drawing a line with thickness. But since we were drawing our points with a thickness, this allowed us to get away with implementing the Bresenham for 1-pixel thickness. This is less efficient, but works &lt;i&gt;beautifully&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drawing triangles was a trivial step, so was floodfill.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our next hurdle was wrapping our head around the idea that canvas_t has an object of type drawing_t but drawing_t requires canvas_t to mutate the pixel array contained by it. There was a circular dependency arising. We discovered the concept of forward declarations in C++ and this was hence resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To maintain a vector of all drawn objects, we defined another class shape_t which is generic to all the other classes that can be drawn. Save and Load was a trivial step, once we had defined shape_t well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next challenge was to implement Undo, we needed a temporary pixel buffer. But for all practical purposes, we got away with a trick. We popped the last inserted object from our vector of all objects, then we saved it to a temporary file and loaded it. For &lt;i&gt;less enough&lt;/i&gt; objects on the screen, this process was instantaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C. All&#39;s Not Well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot undo consecutive fill actions, hangs the program indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any invalid input while entering colors and widths hangs the program indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we have a window size larger than the screen, the co-ordinate reported by the mouse is offset by the amount the window is clipped out of the screen, resulting in incomprehensible behaviour often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;D. Thank You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really had a lot of fun doing this assignment, and learnt a lot more about C++ as well, along with reinforcing the graphics concepts learnt in classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent coding: ~12 hours &lt;br /&gt;
Time spent drawing: ~6 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Used default parameter values in declaration of method rather than definiton following &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/4989505/1928133&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Usage of glDrawPixels and the method to store array in canvas_t inspired from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cs.mun.ca/~blangdon/opengl/glDrawPixels.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Witcher, Game of Thrones and Predestination: Inspirations from Irish Mythology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was home for the past one week, having a compulsory vacation enforced by my family. I spent it reading the Witcher series. To those of you who don&#39;t know about them, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski#The_Witcher_Saga&quot;&gt;The Witcher&lt;/a&gt; is a polish fantasy series by Andrzej Sapkowski. In the opinion of many, what makes them distinctive from fantasy series like LOTR and Harry Potter are the grey shades of morality portrayed in the world. In LOTR and HP, there is a good and there is an evil and at the end of the day, the good has to triumph over evil. In Witcher, every decision taken has varying consequences for different characters; good and bad. This fascinates the eye, because of its &lt;i&gt;natural&lt;/i&gt; appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Game of Thrones, the popular TV series, is the second thing that comes to my mind when you think of a grey portrayal of the world. I have not read the ASOIF books, but I am an avid follower of the show and hence believe I have an idea of the major keypoints of the show. And what I&#39;ll be talking about here are the striking similarities on some of the plotlines of Witcher and Game of Thrones. Some of them are built out of fan theories I read about GoT as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political and sexual intrigue, although since Witcher centers around one individual and his destiny, the political aspects are perhaps not as elaborate as GoT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Witcher has an elven race &lt;i&gt;Aen Sidhe&lt;/i&gt;, and GoT&#39;s white walkers are like &lt;i&gt;sidhe&lt;/i&gt; made of ice, both derived from Ao Si in Irish mythology. We also know that Children of the Forest made White Walkers so they represent &lt;i&gt;Aen Sidhe&lt;/i&gt; better, and then they have a sister race called &lt;i&gt;Aen Elle&lt;/i&gt; which looks like a representation of the Others in Irish mythology, and of WW in GoT. Witcher&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Aen Elle&lt;/i&gt; have their own version of rogue riders called the Wild Hunt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A major problem which surrounds the world as per a prophecy is the coming of a great winter; a great iceage, the Big Winter, the Big Chill, Aep Deireadh and many other names used for a long iceage. Witcher brings in a bit of science too by discussing that this will be effectively due to a change in tilt of Earth&#39;s axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both of them have a central character who can travel through Space and Time. This is Witcher&#39;s Cirilla or Ciri, and GoT&#39;s Brandon Stark. Although, in the case of GoT, it is only fan theories which talk about a predestination. Witcher, on the other hand, is very explicit to center the story around Ciri&#39;s predestination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent long hours searching for popular Irish mythological stories so we could establish a connection. Witcher was published before ASOIF and ASOIF was published by the time Witcher was well known to the English speaking world. These are just my reflections.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Slicing Python Lists</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A lot many are familiar with Python lists and the feature of slicing, although I find the description that most tutorials not intuitive enough. Here is how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;
Let us start with defining an array of 10 elements
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [i for i in range(10)]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, the following I assume you&#39;re familiar with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[3:6]
[3, 4, 5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the way people think about it is selecting elements starting with &lt;i&gt;index 3&lt;/i&gt; till and including the element with &lt;i&gt;index 6-1=5.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do you digest that? I cannot. Why do I include the first index while not the second one? If I think in terms of indices, I have to spend my brain power in subtracting the second index by one, and I tell you I am very lazy about that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Then there are people who say that you start with &lt;i&gt;index 3&lt;/i&gt; and choose &lt;i&gt;6-3=3&lt;/i&gt; elements there on. This does work because we see the following happening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[4:4]
[]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But I do not understand that if I were inventing slicing, and I would want people to think in terms of an index and a length, why would I not just keep length as the second parameter? In this &lt;b&gt;hypothetical&lt;/b&gt; situation,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[3:3]
[3, 4, 5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;DISCLAIMER: I do not claimer that this is how it went but I&#39;ll now talk about how I like to look at slicing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[3:]
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like to say that doing this &lt;i&gt;skips&lt;/i&gt; the first &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; elements and gives the rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[:6]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And this picks the first &lt;i&gt;six&lt;/i&gt; elements. Simple really!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[3:6]
[3, 4, 5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This just gives the &lt;i&gt;intersection&lt;/i&gt; of the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My two cents.

        <title>Circle enclosing N lattice points</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know?&lt;br /&gt;For every natural number N, there exists a circle enclosing exactly N lattice points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/26vUCSK9K5wTm5fwI/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif demonstrating fact&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above was posted on the Facebook group of Math n Physics Club of my institute. It triggered a discussion about the center of such a circle with one guy commenting without reason enough that it has to be an irrational point and any irrational point would do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting and thought over it while taking a shower. &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; the center is at origin, then this is impossible. If you try to enclose a point at a distance $\sqrt{d^2}$, you will find that $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$ where you don&#39;t have a unique choice of $x$ and $y$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now note that if the center is a rational point, say $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{c}{d})$, then you can scale the space by $bd$, then the center lies at $(ad,bc)$ and then a simple translation will take you to origin and our hypothesis is reduced to the above case raising a contradiction against our assumption that the center is a rational point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the center must be an irrational point. I do not know if any irrational point would do though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two cents!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On DSLR-Description</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in custody of the Canon EOS 700D camera owned by Krittika-Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay. I&#39;ve always been able to have the IQ level to snap a picture from the camera required at social gatherings but have never been able to make sense of all the variety of features that it brings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took an attempt to study the specifications of the camera and learn how to use it to get good pictures for specific situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/media/75dos_dslr.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Webcam Spectrograph using RPi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a webcam spectrograph using an optical CD as the diffraction grating as our course project for Waves, Oscillation and Optics (EP 226). As processing the camera images on a computer would be too boring, we used an RPi board with embedded camera which we happened to have. The RPi could process and transmit the data over WiFi enabling us to access the results from any computer, in principle. This made the spectrograph completely portable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our professor suggested many possible improvements onto this which would make it a cheap product for schools. They include distancing the grating from the camera and using a good grating rather than the CD which has curved grooves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCOpMDIkoW5DiRjUoKt6KazmboxlhlZCXlEeynKLJM0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; drive link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 body Simulation using FPGA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to make something using Terasic DE0-Nano boards equipped with Altera Cyclone IV E FPGA as a part of our course project in Digital Electronics Lab(EP 230). We went around to explore what are some things which an FPGA can do better than a CPU. Starting with High Frequency Trading and Bitcoin computation, we evolved our idea into N body simulation which we could complete for 3 body simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is easy to grasp. Consider that you are simply calculating the vector r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This requires 3 subtractions which a simple CPU will serially do, but on an FPGA we can program three subtractors to work in parallel. The improvement in speed is challenged by a requirement of larger hardware(Flops per unit area), but hardware is cheap and time is not, thus FPGAs seek good applications in high performance computing till date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full abstract can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;/media/fpga_doc.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the presentation is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZKQbFShL-eHozx8fI_xyVnHJPRaeSnEXDdIa1Blzi0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; drive link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Photometry-Techniques and Applications</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fundamental principles and pre-requisites to astronomical photometry was introduced. We then proceeded to discuss some practical applications including a demonstration on light curve analysis at planethunters.org
&lt;/p&gt;
