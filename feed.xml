    <description>I am Kumar Ayush, an Engineering Physics sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I love to cook, travel, socialize and tap into physical sciences. My mood is usually a superposition of psychopath, mad hatter, party animal and curious being and may collapse into any of these when you meet me. This is my personal homepage</description>

        <title>On DSLR-Description</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in custody of the Canon EOS 700D camera owned by Krittika-Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay. I've always been able to have the IQ level to snap a picture from the camera required at social gatherings but have never been able to make sense of all the variety of features that it brings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took an attempt to study the specifications of the camera and learn how to use it to get good pictures for specific situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/media/75dos_dslr.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Webcam Spectrograph using RPi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a webcam spectrograph using an optical CD as the diffraction grating as our course project for Waves, Oscillation and Optics (EP 226). As processing the camera images on a computer would be too boring, we used an RPi board with embedded camera which we happened to have. The RPi could process and transmit the data over WiFi enabling us to access the results from any computer, in principle. This made the spectrograph completely portable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our professor suggested many possible improvements onto this which would make it a cheap product for schools. They include distancing the grating from the camera and using a good grating rather than the CD which has curved grooves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCOpMDIkoW5DiRjUoKt6KazmboxlhlZCXlEeynKLJM0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; drive link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 body Simulation using FPGA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to make something using Terasic DE0-Nano boards equipped with Altera Cyclone IV E FPGA as a part of our course project in Digital Electronics Lab(EP 230). We went around to explore what are some things which an FPGA can do better than a CPU. Starting with High Frequency Trading and Bitcoin computation, we evolved our idea into N body simulation which we could complete for 3 body simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is easy to grasp. Consider that you are simply calculating the vector r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This requires 3 subtractions which a simple CPU will serially do, but on an FPGA we can program three subtractors to work in parallel. The improvement in speed is challenged by a requirement of larger hardware(Flops per unit area), but hardware is cheap and time is not, thus FPGAs seek good applications in high performance computing till date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full abstract can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;/media/fpga_doc.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the presentation is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZKQbFShL-eHozx8fI_xyVnHJPRaeSnEXDdIa1Blzi0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; drive link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Photometry-Techniques and Applications</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fundamental principles and pre-requisites to astronomical photometry was introduced. We then proceeded to discuss some practical applications including a demonstration on light curve analysis at planethunters.org
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MIT Scratch Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We offered a workshop on MIT Scratch followed by a 3-day contest. This is aimed to be an introduction to prgramming for the freshmen batch.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introduction to Positional Astronomy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This offered an introduction to spherical trigonometry and astronomical co-ordinate systems. Fundamental applications such as prediction of eclipses were mentioned.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Metapopulation and Coupled Logistic Maps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion with Prof. Mayank Vahia from TIFR inspired us to study a network of cities using non linear dynamics. The investigation led us towards the study of stability and chaos in coupled logistic maps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IPhO-Rum, 46th IPhO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad&quot;&gt;International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)&lt;/a&gt; is an annual physics competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first IPhO was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2015, IPhO was held in Mumbai, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedures involve international board meetings for discussions on question paper before it is presented to the participants et cetera. Leaders are also required to translate the question paper to their respective languages and submit to the host country. Vote on certain matters was taken by a show of hands, and files downloaded and uploaded via pendrives handled by volunteers. Discussions would require paper notes flowing through the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role, in a team of 3, involved developing a browser-based application which would automate the entire process. The entire code and documentation for IPhOrum is a Github &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/cheekujodhpur/ipho2015/&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Indian National Astronomy Olympiad Program 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Astronomy Olympiad Program is designed to encourage students with good foundations in Physics and Mathematics and an interest in Astronomy to pursue further studies in this field. It involves a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/enrollment/enrollment-for-science-olympiads&quot;&gt;five stage process&lt;/a&gt; leading to participation of Indian team in International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students selected for the third stage are invited to the Orientation Cum Selection Camp. The camp is of about three weeks duration. The camp includes several theoretical, data analysis and observation tests. Students are trained in basic concepts in astronomy and astrophysics during the camp. Orientation is provided to students especially for problem-solving in astronomy, astrophysics and for observational astronomy tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the camp is an interaction between college professors and high school students, student facilitators are invited to bridge the gap. I had the wonderful opportunity of being one of the three facilitators in 2015. Our role involved helping students with general queries regarding astronomy and academia (and life :P). We were also involved in setting up the exams and evaluating the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian team at International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics 2015 gave the best result in all its 9 years of participation, topping the tally with 3 golds and 2 silvers and also winning the team competition.&lt;/p&gt;
