<p>Now I am doing my first formal Graphics course right now. I have ideas about the basic jargon because I spent a week trying to learn DirectX back in school. But ray tracing was definitely something new. In my opinion, any one who has thought a lot about it would gain an intuitive idea about ray tracing, because it's exactly what it says it is. To formally get started with it, I read a book called <i>Introduction to Ray Tracing</i> by Andrew S. Glassner.</p>

<p>Along with this book, I studied the <i>smallpt</i> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/">code by Kevin Beason</a>. This is pretty much codegolfing, because this boasts of being a 99 line cpp code for raytracing. My guide Prof. Parag Chaudhuri emphasized correctness before speed, and hence we concluded that if I achieve the image generated by smallpt using integration of the ray paths along straight lines, we can move on to curved spacetimes just by changing a small function somewhere in the code which controls the said integration. This took more time than expected. The following is the story of what I was doing and the outputs I got, accompanied by what I did to correct for it. Here is an image from smallpt which you can use for reference at every step I talk about below.</p>

<p>I had <i>legendary</i> ideas on how I can move my ray along 3d pixels, also called voxels by many. If the voxel I am in intersects with some sphere in the scene, I break down the current voxel in 8 smaller voxels and travel along them, repeating this until I am some epsilon away from the sphere. Of course when I say <i>legendary</i> I mean stupid. Because here is what I got.</p>
